# Simulations

I love writing simulations! My mind likes to go forward (how do we generate a world?) more than it likes to go backwards aka do modeling. Though of course if you can simulate you can also model, but that's another story. In this repo you'll find a few different simulations I'm working on just for fun :)

### Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life, what a classic! Here I build my own crappy version of it for fun, and then make it probabilistic. I was hoping this might be a novel idea but I did find a research paper on it from 2019. And no wonder, it's a pretty straightforward idea. I love that "living" patterns arise from simple instructions, but why should those instructions be deterministic rather than stochastic? What happens if you make them stochastic? Anyways that's that.

### Swarm

I love swarms, swarm logic, swarm thinking. My first swarm sim is basically just a game. I used to love playing sim ants as a kid and that's basically what I'm doing here. I build a class that stands in for an ant's mind, and a class that represents the world. Then I generate a bunch of ants and have them gather sugar. Lots of fun math and engineering design choices to practice in here!
